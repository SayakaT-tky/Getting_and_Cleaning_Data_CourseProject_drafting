# **Getting and Cleaning Data** course project
The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 

In this project, open data set collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone was utilized. Through the work, the data was cleaned to finally obtain a new tidy data which can be used for later analysis.

This repository contains all files requested for project submission as follows:

* README.md: (This file) Describes what each files are for.
* Codebook.md: Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations made to clean up the data
* run_analysis.R: the R script used to clean up the data to achieve the objectives below:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. Finally output the result to a new file (tidy_data.txt).
